**ProxieWy** is a versatile desktop application designed to simplify the management of multiple proxy servers and intelligently route your network traffic. Define custom rules based on domain names and assign them to different profiles for seamless switching between network configurations. Built with Python and the modern PySide6 (Qt) framework.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üöÄ Proxy Management:**
    *   Easily **add, edit, and remove** various proxy types: `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `SOCKS5`.
    *   Built-in support for **authenticated proxies** (username/password).
    *   **Test proxy connectivity** with a single click to ensure they are working.
*   **üö¶ Rule-Based Routing:**
    *   Define granular rules to forward traffic for specific **domains** (e.g., `example.com`) or **wildcard patterns** (e.g., `*.example.net`).
    *   Route matched traffic through a **chosen proxy** or allow **direct connection**.
    *   Quickly **enable or disable** individual rules without deleting them.
*   **üé≠ Profiles (actually requires proxy engine restart):**
    *   Organize rules into distinct **profiles** (e.g., "Work VPN", "Home Streaming", "Development").
    *   **Switch active profiles** effortlessly via the UI (or future hotkeys).
    *   Designate rules as **global** (apply always) or **profile-specific**.
*   **üñ•Ô∏è System Integration:**
    *   Convenient **system tray icon** displaying the current engine status (Active, Inactive, Error).
    *   Flexible window behavior: **minimize to tray** or **exit** on close.
    *   **(Windows Only)** Seamlessly toggles the **system-wide proxy settings** when the ProxieWy engine is activated/deactivated.
*   **üé® User Interface:**
    *   Modern and intuitive UI built with **PySide6**.
    *   Choose between **Dark** and **Light** visual themes.
    *   Integrated **filtering** for quickly finding specific proxies or rules.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Core Engine:**
    *   Lightweight local proxy server listens for connections (default: `127.0.0.1:8080`).
    *   Intelligently handles `CONNECT` requests (for HTTPS/SOCKS tunnels) and standard HTTP requests based on your defined rules.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

*   **Python:** Version 3.10 or newer is recommended.
*   **PySide6:** The official Qt for Python bindings.
*   **PySocks:** (Optional, but required for `SOCKS5` proxy functionality).

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wyrtensi/ProxieWy.git 
    cd ProxieWy
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (Highly Recommended):
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it:
    # Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS / Linux (Bash/Zsh)
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *(Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file)*
    ```bash
    # requirements.txt should contain:
    # PySide6>=6.5
    # PySocks>=1.7 # If using SOCKS5

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running ProxieWy

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Navigate to the project's root directory (`ProxieWy`).
3.  Execute the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The application will start, typically minimized to the system tray. Click the tray icon to manage ProxieWy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Guide

*   **Settings Location:** Configuration (`settings.ini`) is stored in your standard user application data folder. You can find the exact path in the application logs on startup or typically at:
    *   *Windows:* `%LOCALAPPDATA%\wyrtensi\ProxieWy\settings.ini`
*   **Adding Proxies:** Use the "Proxies" tab -> "Add Proxy" button. Fill in the details (name, type, address, port, auth). Test proxies using the‚ö°Ô∏è icon.
*   **Creating Rules:** Go to the "Rules" tab. Select the desired `Profile` from the dropdown (or "All Rules" for global). Click "Add Rule(s)", enter domain(s) (one per line), and choose the target proxy or "Direct Connection".
*   **Managing Profiles:** Use the "Settings" tab to add, rename, or delete profiles. The **active profile** (determining which rules are currently used by the engine) is selected via the dropdown on the **"Rules" tab**.
*   **How Profiles Work:** The proxy engine uses rules assigned to the **currently active profile** *plus* any rules assigned to **"All Rules (Default)"**.
*   **System Proxy (Windows):** Toggling the main switch (top-left in the sidebar) automatically attempts to enable/disable the Windows system proxy settings. Network-aware applications might need a restart to recognize the change.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Insights

*   **Project Structure:**
    *   `src/gui/`: User interface components (main window, custom widgets).
    *   `src/core/`: Backend logic (proxy engine, rule matcher).
    *   `src/assets/`: Static files (icons, images, `.qss` stylesheets).
*   **Styling:** Uses Qt Style Sheets (`.qss`) located in `src/assets/styles` for theming.
*   **Global Hotkeys:** While the settings UI allows configuring hotkey preferences, actual global registration is not implemented due to cross-platform complexity. This would require additional libraries like `pynput` or `keyboard`.

## üå± Future Ideas (Potential Enhancements)

*   [ ] Add import/export functionality for proxies and rules.
*   [ ] Visual traffic monitoring/logging within the UI.
*   [ ] Cross-platform system proxy configuration (macOS, Linux).
*   [v] Packaging for easier distribution (pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=icon.ico --version-file version.txt --add-data "src/assets/;src/assets/" main.py).
*   [ ] Fast adding selected urls to the proxy rules.
